# Todo-App
I am going to make the todo app using flutter
Let's work to make and deploy it
First let's install flutter:

## Installation
- Go to this website and install the stable version: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile 
- Extract the file and keep it in the Local Disk C
- Copy the bin path and add it to the enviornment variable 
- To check the installation: `flutter doctor`

`flutter create todo`
`cd todo`
`flutter pub get`
`flutter run`

In vscode, We will be working on Web Application and Desktop Application.
For Android we will be installing Android Studio for Android Application.
Similarly, if interested, setup VM and develop Linux/Mac Application.
